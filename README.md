# Turtle project
  in this project i simply went through a library in python using it's documentation to get familiar with turtle library
  in order to be more fruitful project i tried to do some challenges;
#### First challenge : draw a square
  in this challenge i realized that i can simply move forward and turn 90 degrees to left or right and repeat the same process
  until the fourth run.
