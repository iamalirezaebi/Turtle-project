# Turtle project
  in this project i simply went through a library in python using it's documentation to get familiar with turtle library
  in order to be more fruitful project i tried to do some challenges;
#### First challenge : draw a square
  in this challenge i realized that i can simply move forward and turn 90 degrees to left or right and repeat the same process
  until the fourth run.
#### Second challenge : draw a dashed line 
  this was a bit more challenging and i found two methods to do this the first one : using pen down and pen up; and the second
  one : using painting white and black one in a row
